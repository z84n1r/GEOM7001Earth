Course Description: Remote   sensing   or   earth   observation,is   an   important   toolfor   monitoring   and   modelingthe   condition   and   dynamicsofterestrial,   aquatic   and   atmospheric   environments.Theinformation   extracted   from   images   maybe   usedin   many   ways,as   image   or   thematic   maps,directy   in
decision   making,as   estimates   of   biophysical variables   orintegrated with   other spatialinformation   systems   for   further   analysis   and   display.This information can   be collected from   local to globalscales   for   examining   changes   in   the   habitat   of   endangered   faunaor   monitoring   continental   scale deforestation   and   global   scale   oceanic   and   atmospheric   conditions.This   courseis   alogical   progresion   from   the   remote   sensing   concepts   and   skils   introducedin   GEOM2000/7000.GEOM3001/7001 emphasises digital   image   processing for analysis   of remotelysensed   imagery,including   airborne         and   satelite   multi-spectral,hyper-spectral   and   synthetic   aperture   radar   data.Practical   sessions willinvolvea   progression   of   practicals   in the compute   laboratory   using   the   ENVI(Environmentfor   Visualising   Images)software   package.Concepts   andskillacquired   in   these   sessions   wil   be   applied   in the   individual student remote sensing project that   can   be   designed to   suit   your   areaof   interest
Assumed   Background:
Ahighlydesirable   prerequisite   for   this   courseis   to   have   introductory   knowledge   of   remote   sensing   from   GEOM2000   (or   equivalent).Pror   to   tending   image   processingpracticals students are expected to   be familar   with   the   basics   of the   Windows   operating   system   (fle   naming   conventions   and
management).If you   have any concernsor special needs in   relation to this   course   please   see   the   course   coordinator.

1.2 Course   Introduction
Remote   sensing   or   Earth   Observation(EO)Science   is   an   important   toolformonitoring   and   modeling   the   conditionand   dynamics   of terrestrial, aquatic   andatmospheric   environments.The   information   extractedfrom   images   and   remote   cllected   datasets   may   be   usedin   many   ways,asimage   or   thematic   maps,directy   in   decision   making,as   estimates   of   biophysical   variables   orintegrated   with   other   spatialinformation   systems   for   further            analysis and display.This   information can   be collected   fromlocal   toglobal   scalesfor   examining   changes   in   the   habitat   of   endangered   fauna   or monitoring   continental   scaledeforestation   and   global   scale   oceanic   and   atmosphericconditions.
This course is co-taught between   GEOM3001   andGEOM7001.
How this course differs from the   introductoryGEOM 2000/7000 course:
This   courseis   alogical   progression   from   the   remote   sensing   or   Earth   ObservationScience   concepts   and   skill   introduced   inGEOM200.This   course   emphasises   digitalimage   processing for   analysis   of   remotely   sensed   imagery,includingairborne   and   satelite   multi-spectral,hyperspectral,LiDAR and   synthetic   aperture   radar   data.Practical   sessions   willivolve   a   progressionof   practicals   inthe   computer   laboratory   (See   mysinet),usinga combinationof open-source and proprietary software.Concepts and skils acquired   in these   sessions   wil   be   apled   in   the   individual   student   remote   sensingproject that can be designed to suit your area   of   interest.
This course buildsupon thefundamentals taught in GEOM2000/7000and   will   evelop   more   advanced   EO   analyticskils   and   knowledge,including:
·Knowledge of the growing number of big data   EO analytic   platforms,and   gaining   practical   experience with   one   or   more   of these
technologies (e.g.Open   Data Cube(https://www.opendatacube.org/),Microsoft   Planetary Computer   (https://planetarycomputer,microsoft.com/))
·Calculating maps of biophysical tributes (e.g   biomass)by combining   remotely   sensed   data with   ground   dataand/or   empirical   algorthms   ·More advanced theoretical and practical skills for analysing   new sources   of   remote   sensing   data   (eg.spaceborne   LiDAR)
·Design,planandexecute a remote sensing project with detailed   guidance
Course Changes   in   Responseto   Previous Student   Feedback
Feedback from end of semester and mid-semester course evaluationsin   previous years,has   been   used   to   modifyboth   the   lecture   content   and   practicals for GEOM3001/7001.

2.1 Course Aims
The aims of this course enable students to understand,think   and   operate   like   a   remotesensing   analyst   by   providing:
(1)a sound understanding of the   theory of earth observation data   acquisition   and   processing,
(2)thepractical skill to complete data acquisition and   processing   projectsthat   produce   information   products   using   remote sensing   data,and
(3)a detailed understanding of the processesto deliverinformation for   mapping,measurement or   monitoring   applications,in   a   wide   range   of   professions.
Accomplishing these aims develops aplied knowledge,skils,practical experience,and   professional   networks thatenable you   to   collect,process,
analyse andcommunicate about satlite,airborne and drone data.The course willprovide   a   detailedoverview   and   practical   skils   of whatis currenty   possible with remote sensing data for earth observing applications,and   outine the   expanding   possibilties   due   to   the   rapidly   evolving   technology.
